<p align="left"> Welcome! 
I recently graduated from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Univeristy of California, Santa Barbara. My passion in data science includes learning R & Python, tidying data, and proselytizing about the use of ISO 8601. I dream of becoming a computational artist in the future, but for now I am settling for doodling in Procreate.
