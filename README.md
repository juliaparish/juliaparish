<h3 align="center"> Data Science Fellow, UC Riverside </h3>

<p align="left"> Welcome! 
My data science journey began working as a conservation field technican on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, and most recently took me to the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the Univeristy of California, Santa Barbara to study Environmental Data Science in the inaugural Master of EDS program (#MEDS2022). I am currently working as a Data Science Fellow with the [Center for Conservation Biology at UC Riverside](https://ccb.ucr.edu/). My passion in data science includes tidying data, learning about climate modeling, and proselytizing about the use of ISO 8601. I dream of becoming a computational artist in the future, but for now I am settling for doodling in Procreate. Currently learning about Quarto!
